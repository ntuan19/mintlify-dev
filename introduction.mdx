<Tip>New to RevenueCat?
Welcome! If you're adding subscriptions or other in-app purchases to your app, the RevenueCat SDK will handle most of the heavy-lifting without the need to interact with this API directly. See our Quickstart for more information on getting started with RevenueCat.</Tip>

## Should I use this REST API or the RevenueCat SDK?
If you’re adding subscriptions or other in-app purchases to your app for the first time or if you don’t have a backend that stores your Customers' receipts, you’re probably looking to implement the RevenueCat SDK.

If you want to start migrating your existing users to RevenueCat and you have your Customers' receipts stored on your own server, or you want to check subscription status of your users from your own server, the REST API is a great solution.
