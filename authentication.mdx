Authentication for the RevenueCat REST API is achieved by setting the `Authorization` header with a valid API key. You'll find two types of API keys in your RevenueCat dashboard: _public_ and _secret_.

Certain endpoints require secret keys, which should be kept out of any publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth. See our [Authentication guide](https://mintlify.com/docs) for more information.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_REVENUECAT_API_KEY
